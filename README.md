# Comixkcd
An app that displays comics from https://xkcd.com.

## Context
The app was made as a programming challenge for https://shortcut.no.

## Result
Out of the all the desired features, I selected what I thought was most suitable for an MVP, given the timeframe and focused on those. This included the ability to
- Browse through the comics
- See the comic details, including their description
- Favourite the comics, making them available offline
- Share the comics

I also thought it was important to keep track of which comics had been read and not, and decided to include this, even though it was not explicitly asked for.
